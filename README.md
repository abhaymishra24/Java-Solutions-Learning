Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. 
It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.

### Project description✍️ 
In this project, I am working on various Java programming questions and problems. I aim to learn new solutions and tackle Java programming challenges ranging from basic to advanced, while also learning OOPs concepts. I am also utilizing Java libraries for some of these problems. Additionally, I am trying to learn how to solve more complex problems and apply these skills to real-world scenarios.

### Objective✍️

- Make an effort to learn new functions, recursion, loops, input/output (I/O), libraries, and more. 
- Build a good understanding of Oops concepts along with questions, problems, and their solutions.
- Aim to upskill myself with new technologies and enhance my problem-solving skills
- Try to explore new things in technology using the Java programming language.
